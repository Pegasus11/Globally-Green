        What is Global Warming? Global warming is the gradual increase in the overall temperature of the Earth’s atmosphere mainly because of the greenhouse effect. The greenhouse effect is when greenhouse gasses rise to the atmosphere and trap the heat and sunlight. The heat melts the icebergs in polar regions which contributes to rising levels in sea water elevation. Many large land masses may get flooded if this continues to happen. Global warming is not good for our Earth.

    <h2>Causes of Global Warming:</h2>
    <p>
        We know that global warming is caused by greenhouse gasses. But how are greenhouse gasses exactly released into the atmosphere? There are a few main ways that greenhouse gasses are released into the atmosphere. The first one is fossil fuels. Fossil fuels are resources such as coal that are found deep in the Earth and are usually burned for fuel. When burned, fossil fuels release carbon dioxide which is a greenhouse gas. The second way is fertilizers. Fertilizers are used to help plants grow and are usually some form of waste. Fertilizers release toxic fumes and carbon dioxide. The third way is overproduction of livestock. Did you know sheep burps contribute to global warming? It’s true! Animals such as cows and goats release a lot of carbon dioxide into the air. The last and final way is deforestation. With oxygen-producing trees being cut down, more carbon dioxide is lingering in the air. Last but not least, fuel cars produce carbon dioxide which result in greenhouse emissions. These are a few ways that greenhouse gasses enter the atmosphere.

    <h2>Effects of Global Warming:</h2>
    <p>
        What are the effects of global warming? Because of all the heat trapped in the Earth’s atmosphere, the icebergs would melt and numerous animals would lose their homes. Additionally, sea levels would rise because of all the melting ice and massive land masses would be flooded. There would also be many more droughts and heat waves. There would be a higher chance of wildfires in forests. Another important effect would be the water supply on Earth declining and reduced agriculture supply. We need to stop global warming. The numerous harmful effects could wipe out the human race.

    Besides from how bad our situation with global warming is, what are we humans currently doing to stop global warming? Scientists are creating new technologies to help reduce the emission of greenhouse gasses. Scientists have created new green fuels such as biodiesel which could eliminate the use of fossil fuels in the future. They are also using wind and water energy to extinguish the need of fossil fuels for electricity. Furthermore, they are setting prices on carbon and protecting forests from deforestation. Even though people are helping, it isn’t enough. Global warming is still a huge issue.

    What can we do to stop global warming? We can reduce greenhouse gas emissions with a few everyday actions. First, we should use electricity sparingly because the more you use, the more fossil fuels are needing to be burned for the electricity; maybe also replace your bulbs with LED lights. Second of all, we could find other ways to transport ourselves other than cars such as walking, biking, or carpooling which saves many greenhouse gas emissions. Third, we could buy electric cars which don’t emit carbon dioxide versus buying a fuel car which burns carbon dioxide every second. You could also change your energy source to solar panels which don’t produce any greenhouse gasses. Last but not least, you should try not to waste food. How does this help? You see, when food rots in landfills, it produces greenhouse gasses. These are a few ways we can stop global warming.
